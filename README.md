P.S.
Run the Code in VSCode:
* Using the Terminal:
Open the integrated terminal by going to View > Terminal from the top menu. Then navigate to the folder where your Python file is located using the cd command. Finally, run your Python script by typing python filename.py, replacing filename with your actual file's name.
* Using the Run Button:
At the top of the file, you might see a green triangle (play) icon. Click it to run the script. If you don't see the icon, click the Run and Debug icon on the left sidebar (looks like a bug) and then click the green play button in the top toolbar.
